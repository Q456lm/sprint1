Echo of Terminal 7 is a top-down sci-fi shooter where players navigate a hub to solve four distinct logic puzzles—ranging from pattern recognition to code decryption—before unlocking a final boss fight. 
The game utilizes vector-based physics for fluid player movement and a custom particle system to create dynamic visual effects during combat.

Although the primary game loop and boss encounter are fully playable, time constraints limited the scale of the map. 
We were unable to implement additional exploration zones or expand the variety of puzzle mechanics beyond the initial set provided in the central hub.
